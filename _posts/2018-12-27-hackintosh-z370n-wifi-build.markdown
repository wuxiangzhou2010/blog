This is my first Hackintosh build, before I actually started to buy component, I had done a lot of search  mostly on [`tonymacx68`](http://www.tonymacx86.com) and [`hackintosher`](https://hackintosher.com/). This build is mainly for everday use and sometimes a little code development.

The main installation process is as follows

1. Use a MacOS to download MacOS image from Mac app store
2. Format a USB and flash the OS iamge to USB 
   - use `diskutil`, choose the USB drive
   - erase: name, `usb`, format `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)`, schema `GUID Partition Map`
   - open a terminal, flash with

        ```sh
        sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ .app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/usb --nointeraction
        ```

3. Mount EFI folder and corret EFI (using clover bootloader/clover configurator)
4. Reboot and set proper BIOS options, save your modification.
5. Boot from USB installer and install MacOS on a SSD

   - you may need to format the disk before install on the drive
   - name: `hackintosh_hd`, format: `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)`, schema: `GUID Partition Map`

6. Put the same EFI folder on the new MacOS

### Todo

1. case
  
    Change the case to a larger one, say Inwin 301 matx case. This will make a lot room for other staff like graphic card.

2. Graphic card

    I found amd card, like rx580 work out of the box, As my girl friend want to do photo work like PS and AE, maybe I need to add a graphic card.

3. wifi
  
    I Plan to use an Apple part to get wifi work out of the box. I do a lot of search and found that `bcm94360cs2` with m.2 adapter works fine. However the Inwin itx case is two small to fit the adapter. A larger case is needed.

4. Magic trackpad

    I heard a lot that Apple's trackpad is a must for real Macos experience.
